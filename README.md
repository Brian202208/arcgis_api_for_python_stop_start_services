### **ArcGIS Service Management Scripts Documentation**  

## **Overview**  
These scripts are designed to manage ArcGIS server services, allowing administrators to start or stop services efficiently. They utilize the **ArcGIS API for Python** to interact with the GIS infrastructure, making it easier to automate service management.

## **Prerequisites**  
Before using these scripts, ensure you have the following:  
+ Python 3 installed  
+ ArcGIS API for Python installed (`pip install arcgis`)  
+ Access to an ArcGIS server with admin credentials

---

## **Installation**  
1. Clone or download the script files.  
2. Install dependencies using:  
   ```bash
   pip install arcgis
   ```
3. Update the scripts with the correct ArcGIS server credentials.

## **Script 1: `arcgis_api_python_services.py`**  

### **Description**  
This script provides a **template** for automating the management of ArcGIS services across multiple servers. It is designed to **start services automatically** while scanning for folders and managing services within them. By uncommenting the appropriate function calls (`service.start()` or `service.stop()`), the script can be easily adapted to either **start or stop services**, making it a flexible foundation for ArcGIS service management automation.

### **How It Works**
1. Connects to ArcGIS using the `GIS` module.  
2. Retrieves a list of available GIS servers.  
3. Iterates through services and **starts them** (default).  
4. Identifies folders and subfolders inside the server.  
5. Starts services within those folders.  


## **Script 2: `function_start_stop_services.py`**  

### **Description**  
This script allows administrators to **start or stop** ArcGIS services dynamically using command-line arguments.  

### **How It Works**
1. Takes a command-line argument (`start` or `stop`).  
2. Connects to the ArcGIS server.  
3. Iterates through all services and performs the requested action.  
4. Retrieves folder structures and starts/stops services inside folders.  

### **Code Structure**
```python
def function_start_stop_services(action):
    gis = GIS("", "", "")

    for server in gis.admin.servers.list():
        for service in server.services.list():
            if action == "start":
                service.start()
            elif action == "stop":
                service.stop()
```

### **Usage**
Run the script with the desired action:  
```bash
python function_start_stop_services.py start
```
or  
```bash
python function_start_stop_services.py stop
```

### **Expected Output**
```
Service started: Service_A
Service started: Service_B
...
```

---

## **Error Handling**
- If an invalid argument is passed (`python function_start_stop_services.py invalid`):  
  ```
  Invalid action. Please specify 'start' or 'stop'.
  ```
- If a service fails to start/stop, the error is logged:  
  ```
  Failed to start/stop service: Service_X
  Error: [Detailed error message]
  ```

---

## **Script 3: `function_start_stop_services_external.py`**  

### **Description**  
This script is designed to **start or stop all services** on a standalone ArcGIS Server. It supports managing services across all folders dynamically.

### **How It Works**
1. Takes a command-line argument (`start` or `stop`).  
2. Connects to the ArcGIS server.  
3. Iterates through all services and performs the requested action.  
4. Identifies all hosted services, including those in folders.  

### **Usage**
Run the script with the desired action:  
```bash
python function_start_stop_services_external.py start
```
or  
```bash
python function_start_stop_services_external.py stop
```

### **Expected Output**
```
Service started: Service_A
Service started: Service_B
...
```

---

## **Script 4: `function_start_stop_services_stantec.py`**  

### **Description**  
This script is specifically tailored to **start or stop services within the "Stantec" folder** on a standalone ArcGIS Server.

### **How It Works**
1. Takes a command-line argument (`start` or `stop`).  
2. Connects to the ArcGIS server.  
3. Iterates through all services within the "Stantec" folder and performs the requested action.  

### **Usage**
Run the script with the desired action:  
```bash
python function_start_stop_services_stantec.py start
```
or  
```bash
python function_start_stop_services_stantec.py stop
```

### **Expected Output**
```
Service started: Service_X
Service started: Service_Y
...
```

---

## **Error Handling**  
- If an invalid argument is passed (`python function_start_stop_services.py invalid`):  
  ```
  Invalid action. Please specify 'start' or 'stop'.
  ```
- If a service fails to start/stop, the error is logged:  
  ```
  Failed to start/stop service: Service_X
  Error: [Detailed error message]
  ```
